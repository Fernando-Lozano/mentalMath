This is a simple mental math exercize. Any equations that are answered incorrectly re-surface every 4th time.

Ideas:
  Equations that take a set duration to answer also re-surface every 4th time(may need to tweek the time answered).
    The issue with this is that super beginners could be answering the same 4 equations over and over. However, this may not necesarily be a bad thing.
